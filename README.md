I'm Sujant ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ and I love computers.

I'm driven by my curiosity, the ambition to do great work and be useful to the world with technology.

I hate remaining a mid (though i am rn), I'll push myself to becoming one of the best.

I dive deep into what strikes my interest, Bitcoin is goated leading me to blockhains (pretty cool) and I did some work: participated & won a prize in EthCC'22 Paris hackathon, worked at gitcoin building a DAO tool, read ton of papers & it was fun.

I did some CV in 2020 but wasn't moved (i was dumb), I'm working on deep learning, NLP, LLMs, VLMs etc and I will build something great here... so fumk your react codebase, jira tickets & strategy meetings, I wanna work on technology that can ACCELERATE this era of humanity forward: e/acc (iykyk)

Aside, I'm a dharmic culture enjooyer, an avid anime fan wanting to usher to a techno-dharmic yug-cybera future.
